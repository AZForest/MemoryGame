# MemoryGame

MemoryGame is a simple matching game that allows users to turn over 2 cards at a time to see if they match. If the 2 cards match, the 2 cards are removed from the board. If they do not match, both cards are turned back over and remain on the board. Number of moves is tracked by the app.
